\label{ch:faq}

\section{When will my job start?}

\ifgent
See the explanation about how jobs get prioritized in \autoref{subsec:priority}.
\else
\ifbrussel
In practice it's impossible to predict when your job(s) will start,
since most currently running jobs will finish before their requested walltime
expires, and new jobs by may be submitted by other users that are assigned a higher
priority than your job(s).
\else
You can use the \lstinline|showstart| command. For more information, see \autoref{sec:monitoring-and-managing-your-jobs}.

\section{Can I share my data with other \hpc users?}

Yes, you can use the \lstinline|chmod| or \lstinline|setfacl| commands to change permissions
of files so other users can access the data. For example, the following command
will enable a user named ``otheruser'' to read the file named \lstinline|dataset.txt|.
See

\begin{prompt}
%\shellcmd{setfacl -m u:otheruser:r dataset.txt}%
%\shellcmd{ls -l dataset.txt}%
-rwxr-x---+ 2 %\userid{}% mygroup      40 Apr 12 15:00 dataset.txt
\end{prompt}

For more information about \lstinline|chmod| or \lstinline|setfacl|, see \href{\LinuxManualURL#sec:chmod}
{the section on chmod in chapter 3 of the Linux intro manual}.
